This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that explores the rental market in Berlin using data from ImmoScout24, a popular German real estate website. The notebook contains Python code for data cleaning, data visualization, and data analysis.

**Getting Started**\
To get started with this project, you will need to clone this repository to your local machine and open the Apartment-Rental-Offers-Berlin.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab. You will also need to have Python 3 installed, along with the following libraries:

Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Plotly
Scikit-learn
Geopandas
You can install these libraries using pip or conda. For example:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly scikit-learn geopandas

**Data**\
The data used in this project comes from ImmoScout24 and was collected in October 2020. It contains information about apartment rental offers in Berlin, including the location, size, price, and other features of each offer.

**Notebook Overview**\
The notebook is divided into several sections:

Data Cleaning: This section cleans the raw data by removing duplicates, missing values, and outliers.
Data Exploration: This section explores the distribution of the data and the relationships between the different features.
Spatial Analysis: This section uses geospatial data to visualize the distribution of rental offers across the city of Berlin.
Price Prediction: This section trains a machine learning model to predict the price of an apartment based on its features.

**Results**\
The analysis reveals several interesting insights about the rental market in Berlin, including:

The most expensive neighborhoods are located in the city center and in the west of the city.
The size of an apartment has a strong correlation with its price.
The age of the building and the presence of a balcony or terrace also have an impact on the price.
Machine learning models can be used to predict the price of an apartment with a reasonable degree of accuracy.
